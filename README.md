# About
A simple Python script to rid Ubuntu 18.10 and above of Snaps and prevent them from coming back.

# Dependencies
To run this script, you'll need python3. Ubuntu comes with it by default, but just in case run this command in the terminal:
```
sudo apt install python3
```

# Running the Script
To run the script download the latest release of desnapper and extract the downloaded file. You should then see a new folder called "desnapper-main." Open a terminal to the path of the extracted folder and run:
```
python3 desnapper.py
```
