# About
DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT AT THE MOMENT. IT'S STILL ACTIVELY BEING DEVELOPED AND TESTED.

A simple Bash script to rid Ubuntu of Snaps and prevent them from coming back.

# Running the Script
To run the script download the .zip file from the code button and extract the file. You should now see a new folder. Open a terminal pointed to the folder's path and run these commands:
```
chmod u+x desnapper.sh
./desnapper.sh
```
