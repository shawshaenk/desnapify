# About
A simple Python script to rid Ubuntu of Snaps and prevent them from coming back.

Note: As of right now, this script is meant specifically for Ubuntu, not its flavors. This may change later.

# Dependencies
To run this script, you'll need python3. Ubuntu comes with it by default, but just in case, run this command in the terminal:
```
sudo apt install python3
```

# Running the Script
To run the script download the .zip file from the code button and extract the file. You should now see a new folder. Open a terminal pointed to the folder's path and run this command:
```
python3 desnapper.py
```
