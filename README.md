# About
A simple Python script to rid Ubuntu 18.10 and above of Snaps.

# Dependencies
To run this script you'll need python3. Ubuntu comes with it by default, but just in case run:
```
sudo apt install python3
```

# Running the Script
To run the script, download the latest release, and extract the downloaded file. You should now see a new folder called "desnapper-main." Open a terminal to the path of the extracted folder. Then, just run:
```
python3 desnapper.py
```
